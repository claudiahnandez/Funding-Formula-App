# Funding-Formula-App
I do not want to get too much in the details about what the purpose of this app mostly because it would
require me extensivly explaining how it is that California Community Colleges get paid with a number
refered to as FTES. I will just go ahead and describe the meat of this.

## The UI

So first off, I think it is excellent practice to divy up you app into two seperate files, the UI and 
the server portion. As you can see this app is very simple however I would like to point out, in what
I see to be one of the best functionaloties in this app and that is the ability to download an excel 
file of the data provided. Why is an excel spreadsheet needed? Well to sum up, the data in the server
I am working with has limited access, only a select number of people interact with it. The apps where
made for the faculty of the school so they can keep track of many aspects of the college, this faculty
might need the data for other purposes so it was important to include it.

## The Server

To be honest there is not something super interesting about the layout of this app, it is pretty self 
explanetory. I put the code up because there is limited example of what a shiny app can do. There is
a website call <a href="https://www.showmeshiny.com/">Show Me Shiny</a> with good examples but some
of those apps you can notice not a lot of effort went into making them. If you like my setup you are
more than welcome to copy it. I comment pretty profusely so hopefully everything is understandable enough.

<strong><i>Note: the code is up but will not run on R studio because it needs immediate access to a server for the school I work for. For security resons, this server is not accessible. A link to the app will be posted soon..</i></strong>
